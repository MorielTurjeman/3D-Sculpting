Are you tired of using a big ass pottery wheel which takes up a lot of space and creates a big mess? ðŸ˜«

Then you've come to the right place!

Our project lets you create a **digital** 3D sculpture and:
- stretch it
- rotate it
- scale it
- move it around
and you can use the mouse **and** your hands to do that, all in the same program!!
